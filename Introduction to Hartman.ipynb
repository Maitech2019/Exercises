    "* <b>A cell</b> is each individual box within the notebook. Each cell will include various code, and because the cells are all separate, your code will be amazingly organized within your notebook. Some code needs to be in it's own cell -- while other code can be grouped into one cell together. \n",

    "\n",
    "You can change the type of cell you are typing into by utilizing the dropdown menu above. Click the cell below this one -- in the dropdown box above it should say \"CODE\" because that cell is in Command Mode. Next, click the cell below that one, the dropdown menu should now say \"MARKDOWN\" because that cell is in Edit mode. You can change the type of cell at any time by just clicking the cell and changing the option in the dropdown box. Unless you are planning to write blocks of text within your notebook, we are going to be sticking primarily with cells in Command mode within this class. "

Comments are chunks of text that are written above, below, alongside, etc. lines of code within a cell that is marked as \"Code\" (or in command mode). These chunks of text will be visable to you, but will NOT be executed as part of the rest of the code. Basically, you are marking your code with commentary -- for your own understanding or to allow someone else reading your code to better understand what you were doing. Get into the practice of writing descriptive comments along with all of your code. While you are learning variaous skills, it will be invaluable for you to notate the purpose of each section of code. Throughout the course lessons, you will find valuable information in the comments that I include in my code. \n",
